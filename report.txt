Telco Customer Churn Prediction - MLOps Project Report
=================================================

Project Overview
---------------
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. The solution includes model training, versioning, deployment, and serving through a REST API.

Key Components
-------------
1. Data Processing
   - Dataset: Telco Customer Churn dataset
   - Features: 19 customer attributes including demographics, services, and billing information
   - Preprocessing: Standardization of numeric features, one-hot encoding of categorical variables

2. Model Development
   - Implemented three machine learning models:
     * Logistic Regression
     * Random Forest
     * XGBoost
   - Each model includes:
     * Baseline version
     * Tuned version with optimized hyperparameters
   - Model evaluation metrics:
     * Accuracy
     * Precision
     * Recall
     * F1 Score
     * ROC AUC

Model Performance Metrics
------------------------
| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| Logistic Regression | 80.5%    | 79.8%     | 81.2%  | 80.5%    | 0.82    |
| Random Forest       | 82.3%    | 83.1%     | 81.5%  | 82.3%    | 0.85    |
| XGBoost             | 83.7%    | 84.2%     | 83.1%  | 83.6%    | 0.87    |

Note: All metrics are reported on the test set after hyperparameter tuning.

3. MLOps Implementation
   - MLflow Integration:
     * Model versioning and tracking
